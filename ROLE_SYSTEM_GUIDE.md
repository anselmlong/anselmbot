# Role-Based System Guide

## Overview
The bot now supports a **role-based system** where users can be either a **boyfriend** or **girlfriend**. Each role has access to different content and can submit content for their partner.

## How It Works

### 1. Role Assignment
- When users first start the bot, they need to set their role
- Click "ðŸ‘¤ set my role" to choose between boyfriend or girlfriend
- Once set, users can change their role anytime by clicking their role button

### 2. Role-Based Content
- **Pictures**: Each role sees different photos submitted by their partner
- **Telebubbles**: Each role receives different bubble messages from their partner
- **Other content** (jokes, flirt messages, motivation, etc.) remains shared

### 3. Content Submission
Users can submit content for their partner:
- **ðŸ“¤ submit photo for partner**: Upload photos that your partner will see
- **ðŸ«§ submit bubble for partner**: Write bubble messages for your partner
